## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

1. **Start with `Numpy_100_Paper_GiGi.ipynb`:**  
   Try solving each problem on your own in the blank cells provided. Take your time and donâ€™t peek at the answers just yet.

2. **Check `Numpy_100_Key_GiGi.ipynb`:**  
   Once youâ€™ve tried a problem, compare your approach with mine. Learn from the optimized solutions and comments.

3. **Read `GiGi_Explanation.txt`:**  
   Deepen your understanding of *why* each concept matters and how it connects to real-world applications.

4. **Repeat** until you feel confident! ðŸ’ª
